CSE3341 Core Parser, Printer, Executor Project

Overview:

This project consists of Many Python scripts, Mian script is (interpreter.py) where Main  to run the program,
The purpose of the project is to parse, print, and execute programs written in a custom programming language.

Files:
interpreter.py: This is the main Python script responsible for interpreting the input programs.
prog.py: This script contains the implementation of the core parser, printer, and executor 
data\test.txt & data.txt Files:
These files contain input programs that should be parsed, printed, and executed correctly.

Running the Program:
To run the interpreter program, execute the following command in the Python terminal:

py interpreter.py <core_program_file> <data_file>

Replace <core_program_file> with the name of the input file containing the program to be interpreted, and <data_file> with the name of the input file containing the data for execution.

Example:(Copy and past) code

py interpreter.py data\test.txt data\data.txt

This will parse, print, and execute the program test1.txt using the data from testdata1.txt
